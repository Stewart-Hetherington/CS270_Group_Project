<h4 align="center">The primary way to deal with panic attacks is to be A.W.A.R.E., which consists of 5 steps:</h4>
<br>
<div align="center">
<h4><b>A</b>cknowledge & <b>A</b>ccept</h4>
<h4><b>W</b>ait & <b>W</b>atch</h4>
<h4><b>A</b>ction(s)</h4>
<h4><b>R</b>epeat</h4>
<h4><b>E</b>nd</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Acknowledge</b> -> Recognise that you are beginning to feel panicked and you are afraid. You will not ignore it,
 or struggle to distract yourself from it. Acknowledge that you are afraid, but not in danger.
</p>
<p><b>Accept</b> -> Accept that you are afraid of this moment. Do not fight or blame yourself for feeling afraid. 
Fighting the fear will only make it feel more legitimate and true.
</p>
<p><b>Wait</b> -> Before making a rash decision, wait it out. By waiting you will eventually regain the ability to think rationally.
 Your fear will begin to lessen eventually
 and your brain will associate waiting with reduced fear, instead of running away from the problem which causes more fear.
</p>
<p><b>Watch</b> -> Observe how the panic works. Keep a panic diary which notes important aspects of panic attacks so you can deal 
with them more effectively. Doing this may help you feel more like an observer to panic and less of a victim. Filling out this 
diary during a panic attack helps the most.
</p>
<p><b>Action</b> -> Now it's time to deal with the panic attack. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Breathing</b>: Perform a deep breathing exercise. Sit comfortably if possible. Place one hand on your chest and one on your stomach.
 Breath in slowly and deeply through your nose for 4 seconds and notice your lower hand rising on your belly. Then
 out for 4 seconds until your lungs are empty, and notice your lower hand descending. Repeat this exercise as necessary.</li>
<li><b>Talk to yourself</b>: Tell yourself softly what you are experiencing, ask yourself "is this danger or discomfort?", and avoid
 "what if...?" statements. These statements are only proof that your fears are 
not actually happening anyways. Focus on physical sensations.</li>
<li><b>Focus on your body</b>: Listen to your body and focus on the parts that are most tense. Try to relax and don't forget to keep breathing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Repeat</b> -> At this point, all you have to do is repeat the steps above, over and over, as many times as you need. It may be difficult at first,
 but with enough effort and practice it will get easier to deal with the panic.
</p>
<p><b>End</b> ->  In time with enough repetition the panic attacks will lessen and eventually subside. It's important 
to expect the best. Focus on the experience of succeeding and what is happening now, rather than worrying about the future.
</p>
<p>To summarise in short-hand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the anxiety. Don't try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.</li>
<li>Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try 
to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.</li>
<li>Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don't try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms
 even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.</li>
<li>Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet,
 then repeat the steps. You'll see that you'll calm down soon.</li>
<li>Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don't focus on 
what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.</li>
</ol>
