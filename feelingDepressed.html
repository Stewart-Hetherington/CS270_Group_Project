<h4 align="center">Activities to tackle depression</h4>

<ul>
<li>Try basic rhythmic exercise, such as going for a walk, or cycling, or even performing stretches. This will release endorphins which make you feel better</li>
<li>Meditate into a relaxed state. Simple meditation practices help mitigate recurring negative thoughts and lessen stress and the effects of negative moods</li>
<li>Similar to the above two points, practising yoga is an effective way to relax the body and help take your mind off negative thoughts.</li>
<li>If possible, care for a pet. This gives a sense of purpose and compassion to a person. However, if the responsibility is too much, this idea should be avoided.</li>
<li>Gardening is an alternative to pets, as caring for plants and nurturing and helping them to grow can give you a sense of accomplishment.</li>
<li>Keeping a journal is a good way to track the things that help make you feel good/happy. Writing down at least 3 good things that happened everyday can help boost your mood if you read back over them.</li>
<li>Art, music, reading, writing, etc. are great ways to push away negative thoughts and lose yourself in whatever you are doing.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Reach out and stay connected </li>
<ul>
<li>Look for support from people who make you feel safe and cared for -- find someone you trust who is a good listener and nonjudgemental</li>
<li>Make face-time a priority -- speaking face to face can help overcome stronger feelings of depression</li>
<li>Try to keep up with social activities even if you dont't feel like it -- being around others you feel comfortable with can lessen the effects of depression</li>
<li>Find ways to support others -- helping others can give you the boost to feel better about yourself</li>
<li>Care for a pet -- giving love and companionship to another being can help you come out of your shell and give you a sense of being needed</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li> Do things that make you feel good </li>
<ul>
<li>Take part in a sport or hobby you enjoy</li>
<li>Express yourself though music, art, writing, etc.</li>
<li>Take a day out, either alone or with friends, to enjoy things away from stress, such as mountain hiking or just a trip to the park</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li> Be more active throughout the day </li>
<ul>
<li>Building exercise routines step by step is a great way to improve your mood</li>
<li>You will feel better physically by working out, warming up muscles, etc., and in turn will feel better mentally</li>
<li>Continuous and rhythmic exercises are ideal, such as walking, weight-training, swimming and dancing</li>
<li>Be mindful while being active -- focus on the physical sensations of exercising, such as the beat of your heart or the sensation of your feet on the ground</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>  Eat healthy and well </li>
<ul>
<li>The right diet can help elevate your mood, and going too long without meals worsens the effects of depression</li>
<li>Eating less sugar and refined carbs also aids in reducing mood crashes and energy burns</li>
<li>Citrus fruit, leafy greens, beans, chicken, and eggs are good foods to eat to fend off against depression
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li> Challenge negative thinking </li>
<ul>
<li>It's important to realise that many negative thoughts are just the depression talking</li>
<li>In reality things are almost never as bad as they seem</li>
<li>Ask yourself if the things you're telling yourself are really true</li>
<li>What would you tell a friend who had the same thought?</li>
<li>Is there another way of looking at this situation?</li>
<li>How might you approach this if you weren't dealing with depression?</li>
</ul>
