<h4 align="center">The primary way to deal with panic attacks is to be A.W.A.R.E., which consists of 5 steps:</h4>
<br>
<div align="center">
<h4><b>A</b>cknowledge & <b>A</b>ccept</h4>
<h4><b>W</b>ait & <b>W</b>atch</h4>
<h4><b>A</b>ction(s)</h4>
<h4><b>R</b>epeat</h4>
<h4><b>E</b>nd</h4>
</div>
<p><b>Acknowledge</b> -> Recognise that you are beginning to feel panic and you are afraid. You will not ignore it,
 or struggle to distract yourself from it. Acknowledge that you are afraid, but not in danger.
</p>
<p><b>Accept</b> -> Accept that you are afraid of this moment. Do not fight or blame yourself for feeling afraid. 
Fighting the fear will only make it feel more legitimate and true.
</p>
<p><b>Wait</b> -> Before making a rash decision, wait it out. By waiting you will eventually regain the ability to think rationally.
 Your fear will begin to lessen eventually
 and your brain will associate waiting with reduced fear, instead of running away from the problem which causes more fear.
</p>
<p><b>Watch</b> -> Observe how the panic works. Keep a panic diary which notes important aspects of panic attacks so you can deal 
with them more effectively. Doing this may help you feel more like an observer to panic and less of a victim. Filling out this 
diary during a panic attack helps the most.
</p>
<p><b>Action</b> -> Now it's time to deal with the panic attack. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Breathing</b>: Perform a deep breathing exercise. Sit comfortably if possible. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly.
 Breath in slowly and deeply through your nose for 4 seconds and notice your lower hand rising on your belly. Hold for 2 seconds,
  and then breathe
 out for 6 seconds until your lungs are empty, and notice your lower hand descending. Repeat this exercise as necessary.</li>
<li><b>Talk to yourself</b>: Tell yourself softly what you are experiencing, ask yourself "is this danger or discomfort?", and avoid
 "what if...?" statements. These statements are only proof that your fears are 
not actually happening anyways. Focus on physical sensations.</li>
<li><b>Focus on your body</b>: Listen to your body and focus on the parts that are most tense. Try to relax and donâ€™t forget to keep breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Repeat</b> -> At this point, all you have to do is repeat the steps above, over and over, as many times as you need. It may be difficult at first,
 but with enough effort and practice it will get easier to deal with the panic.
</p>
<p><b>End</b> ->  In time with enough repetition the panic attacks will lessen and eventually subside. It's important 
to expect the best. Focus on the experience of succeeding and what is happening now, rather than worrying towards the future.
</p>
<p>To summarise in short-hand:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the anxiety. Don't try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.</li>
<li>Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try 
to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.</li>
<li>Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don't try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms
 even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.</li>
<li>Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet,
 then repeat the steps. You'll see that you'll calm down soon.</li>
<li>Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don't focus on 
what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="center"> How to combat Anxiety </h2>
<ol>
<li>Write a list of what you know is true </li>
<ul>
<li>To counter what anxiety is telling you, keep a list of things you know are true and possible</li>
<li>For example, "I can handle going to the shop, I have done it before", etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>Read this list 2 - 3 times a day</li>
<ul>
<li>Once you are aware of what is true, you will feel less afraid once anxiety comes</li>
<li>Anxiety makes us "forget what we know" which makes us vulnerable to it.</li>
<li>Having the knowledge and safety you need helps to combat anxious thoughts</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>Try yoga or meditation, or exercise in general</li>
<ul>
<li>These activities help distract the mind from negativity</li>
<li>Additionally they open up the mind to positive thinking and emotion</li>
<li>Physical exercise also helps the mind and body through hormones being released</li>
<li>Walking with a friend is a good way to connect with another person and deal with anxiety</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li> Pinpoint stress areas</li>
<ul>
<li>Try to pinpoint the parts of your life that give you the most stress 
</li>
<li>Then devise possible ways of dealing with them positively</li>
<li>This gives you a goal or set of goals to work towards</li>
<li>Ultimately dealing with stress areas will lessen the impact of anxiety greatly</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>Spend time with others</li>
<ul>
<li>Chatting about your favourite hobbies or subjects to friends is a great way to bond and also relieve anxiety</li>
<li>Talking about your concerns to others you trust can help you understand your fears are not unusual and can be dealt with</li>
<li>Laughter is one of the best medicines</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>Avoid procrastination if possible</li>
<ul>
<li>Putting off things you need to do causes stress and anxiety to buildup</li>
<li>By completing tasks and chores, you will feel a sense of accomplishment</li>
<li>Doing simple things, such as sweeping or organising things, can help relieve stress and anxiety</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>Try creating a routine</li>
<ul>
<li>Getting into the groove of making sure you clean yourself, your surroundings, doing the tasks you need to do, etc., prevents a build up of things you need to do</li>
<li>This helps reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by things and thus reduces anxiety</li>
<li>Routines help in giving you the confidence and control you need to feel strong to deal with your fears</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li> Practice dealing with negative thoughts</li>
<ul>
<li>Challenge negative thinking</li>
<li>Re-associate your mind with positive affirmations, even when you are not experiencing panic or anxiety</li>
<li>Look at things in multiple perspectives</li>
<li>Always remind yourself that your brain will make things out to be worse than they are</li>

<h4>Claustrophobia, the fear of tight or enclosed spaces, is something many people deal with and 
people are all affected by it to different degrees. However it is ultimately important to remember that 
claustrophobia is merely the mind triggering it's "fight or flight" response 
because it sees or is experiencing a situation which causes it to feel threatened.
</h4>
<p>In the short term, there are several things you can do to distract yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count down from 100 softly but out loud, repeating as many times as needed</li>
<li>Talk to friend or family member, even a simple basic conversation can help</li>
<li>If possible, move your body actively: swing your arms, roll your shoulders, clench your fists, move your legs, etc.</li>
<li>Pick and object in the room and focus intently on it, think about anything you can think about this object to help distract you</li>
<li>Slowly and calming reassure yourself that everything is OK, everything is fine, I'm relaxed and this feeling or fear will pass, etc.</li>
<li>Humming or singing (if alone) to provide good distractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claustrophobia can be dealt with by re-associating the mind with positive emotions and feelings when faced with 
the sources of the fear. This can be achieved through <b>anchoring</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> the following is a technique for addressing claustrophobia in the long-term.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Anchoring simply means connecting strong emotions to a stimulus, i.e., 
a song you were listening to during the first time you fell in love. Any strong, powerful, 
positive emotion with a unique stimulus will suffice for an anchor.</li>
<li>Next you pick somewhere to keep your anchor that you can use to activate it, such as 
clenching the fist of your non-writing hand, or pinching the skin, etc. When you perform 
this action, focus intently on the anchor. Let the emotions of that point fill
 you and replace any worries and fears you may be experiencing.</li>
<li>It is important to note also that you are not restricted to only one anchor. 
The more anchors, points of positivity you have, the better equipped you are to fight 
the fear response from claustrophobia. However it is also important to reinforce anchors 
with constant focus. Over time you must strengthen the bond with these anchors so they 
don't fade and weaken or end up being associated with the negative feelings. This process takes time.
</li>
<li>As the positive emotions peak, press on the anchor for 5-10 seconds to cement the appropriate 
feelings to ensure that a strong anchor is made or reinforced. </li>
<li>Repeat focusing on your anchors for as long as the fear persists or until things return to normal.</li>
<li>Anchors can be made even stronger if you practice them during times when you aren't currently dealing 
with claustrophobia. Practice replacing negative emotions with positive ones. Eventually you can begin 
to re-associate the fears with happiness
 and the effects of claustrophobia will lessen over time.</li>
</ol>

<h4 align="center">Activities to tackle depression</h4>

<ul>
<li>Try basic rhythmic exercise, such as going for a walk, or cycling, or even performing stretches. This will release endorphins which make you feel better</li>
<li>Meditate into a relaxed state. Simple meditation practices help mitigate recurring negative thoughts and lessen stress and the effects of negative moods</li>
<li>Similar to the above two points, practising yoga is an effective way to relax the body and help take your mind off negative thoughts.</li>
<li>If possible, care for a pet. This gives a sense of purpose and compassion to a person. However, if the responsibility is too much, this idea should be avoided.</li>
<li>Gardening is an alternative to pets, as caring for plants and nurturing and helping them to grow can give you a sense of accomplishment.</li>
<li>Keeping a journal is a good way to track the things that help make you feel good/happy. Writing down at least 3 good things that happened everyday can help boost your mood if you read back over them.</li>
<li>Art, music, reading, writing, etc. are great ways to push away negative thoughts and lose yourself in whatever you are doing.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Reach out and stay connected </li>
<ul>
<li>Look for support from people who make you feel safe and cared for -- find someone you trust and is a good listener and nonjudgemental</li>
<li>Make face-time a priority -- speaking face to face can help overcome stronger feelings of depression</li>
<li>Try to keep up with social activities even if you donâ€™t feel like it -- being around others you feel comfortable with can lessen the effects of depression</li>
<li>Find ways to support others -- helping others can give you the boost to feel better about yourself</li>
<li>Care for a pet -- giving love and companionship to another being can help you come out of your shell and give you a sense of being needed</li>
</ul>

<li> Do things that make you feel good </li>
<ul>
<li>Take part in a sport or hobby you enjoy</li>
<li>Express yourself though music, art, writing, etc.</li>
<li>Take a day out, either alone or with friends, to enjoy things away from stress, such as mountain hiking or just a trip to the park</li>
</ul>

<li> Attempt being more active throughout the day </li>
<ul>
<li>Building exercise routines step by step is a great way to improve your mood</li>
<li>You will feel better physically by working out, warming up muscles, etc., and in turn will feel better mentally</li>
<li>Continuous and rhythmic exercises are ideal, such as walking, weight-training, swimming and dancing</li>
<li>Be mindful while being active -- focus on the physical sensations of exercising, such as the beat of your heart or the sensation of your feet on the ground</li>
</ul>

<li>  Eat healthy and well </li>
<ul>
<li>The right diet can help elevate your mood, and going too long without meals worsens the effects of depression</li>
<li>Eating less sugar and refined carbs also aids in reducing mood crashes and energy burns</li>
<li>Citrus fruit, leafy greens, beans, chicken, and eggs are good foods to eat to fend off against depression
</li>
</ul>

<li> Challenge negative thinking </li>
<ul>
<li>It's important to realise that many negative thoughts are just the depression talking</li>
<li>In reality things are almost never as bad as they seem</li>
<li>Ask yourself if the things you're telling yourself are really true</li>
<li>What would you tell a friend who had the same thought?</li>
<li>Is there another way of looking at this situation?</li>
<li>How might you approach this if you weren't dealing with depression?</li>
