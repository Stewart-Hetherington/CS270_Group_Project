<h4>Claustrophobia, the fear of tight or enclosed spaces, is something many people deal with and 
people are affected by it to different degrees. However it is ultimately important to remember that 
claustrophobia is merely the mind triggering it's "fight or flight" response 
because it is experiencing a situation which causes it to feel threatened.
</h4>
<p>In the short term, there are several things you can do to distract yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count down from 100 softly but out loud, repeating as many times as needed</li>
<li>Talk to friend or family member, even a simple basic conversation can help</li>
<li>If possible, move your body actively: swing your arms, roll your shoulders, clench your fists, move your legs, etc.</li>
<li>Pick an object in the room and focus intently on it, think about anything you can think about this object to help distract you</li>
<li>Slowly and calming reassure yourself that everything is OK, everything is fine, I'm relaxed and this feeling or fear will pass, etc.</li>
<li>Humming or singing (if alone) to provide good distractions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Claustrophobia can be dealt with by re-associating the mind with positive emotions and feelings when faced with 
the sources of the fear. This can be achieved through <b>anchoring</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> the following is a technique for addressing claustrophobia in the long-term.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Anchoring simply means connecting strong emotions to a stimulus, i.e., 
a song you were listening to during the first time you fell in love. Any strong, powerful, 
positive emotion with a unique stimulus will suffice for an anchor.</li>
<li>Next you pick somewhere to keep your anchor that you can use to activate it, such as 
clenching the fist of your non-writing hand, or pinching the skin, etc. When you perform 
this action, focus intently on the anchor. Let the emotions of that point fill
 you and replace any worries and fears you may be experiencing.</li>
<li>It is important to note also that you are not restricted to only one anchor. 
The more anchors, points of positivity you have, the better equipped you are to fight 
the fear response from claustrophobia. However it is also important to reinforce anchors 
with constant focus. Over time you must strengthen the bond with these anchors so they 
don't fade and weaken or end up being associated with the negative feelings. This process takes time.
</li>
<li>As the positive emotions peak, press on the anchor for 5-10 seconds to cement the appropriate 
feelings to ensure that a strong anchor is made or reinforced. </li>
<li>Repeat focusing on your anchors for as long as the fear persists or until things return to normal.</li>
<li>Anchors can be made even stronger if you practice them during times when you aren't currently dealing 
with claustrophobia. Practice replacing negative emotions with positive ones. Eventually you can begin 
to re-associate the fears with happiness
 and the effects of claustrophobia will lessen over time.</li>
</ol>
